		Several biremes on the dock are burning, the remains of fishing boats float across the waters. The city seems to be in total chaos. In the middle of it all, the Admiral leads a group of stragglers constantly shooting arrows at the Spartan blockade. Suddenly, the Admiral sees you. “OI, <em>Acacius</em>"
		<br> <br>The Admiral then hands you a small gastraphetes, a portable crossbow. “Just fire at an angle towards those warships, that’s all you need to do”.
		<br> <br>Its sunset now and the Spartan ships have started to retreat, their archers slowing down and holding up shields. Reinforcements have finally arrived and you can see the Admiral rolling a oxybeles, a small bolt shooter towards you. “The blockade has nearly ended, now let’s make sure those damn Spartans never come back”.
		<br> <br> has fallen and you are finally getting into bed again. The fleet’s launch has been postponed. Thump,Thump There’s a knock on your door. A sailor steps in. “The Admiral has asked to see you, he’ll be in his cabin” he says before leaving.
