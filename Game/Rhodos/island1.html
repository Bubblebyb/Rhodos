  <h3 class="subheadx">The war has raged on for many years. The Aeolians have dominated the sister kingdoms of Ionia and Doris at both sea and land. The year is 203 B.C.E, the Dorians have sent a small fleet to taunt Aeolian navy bases in Lesvos and then charge for Aonia – the so called “Promised Land”.
The sun shines on Rhodos. Warriors cheer in the streets. They give their final goodbyes to the rookies poor enough to have been assigned to the fleet. They have been awarded with a feast worthy of gods. Everyone knows only a dozen people will return alive. The combined might of Aeolian and Spartan navies is too much for one fleet of recon ships. Yet, no gloom lies upon the city of Kameiros. You look down at the sand. It is wet. Quite possibly, you will be too in a few hours.
You should get to the port, the curfew is only in a few hours, and the sailors’ quarters are a much better bed than the wet sand.
