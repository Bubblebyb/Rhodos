	<h3 class="subheadx">Rhodos is a text based IF or "interactive fiction" game. There are serveral endings to the game. You will only be able to access the next games in the trilogy until you unlock a certain ending. Rhodos is based of the Diadochi period in Ancient Greece. There is a lore around Rhodos that carries onto the other two games in the trilogy. The lore can be found on the Github page for the game
		<a href="https://github.com/Bubblebyb/Rhodos">here</a>. Please keep in mind that the game is in really early development and nearly everything is subject to change - Eamin </h3>
